VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000

# Production Notes:
# - VITE_* variables are compiled at BUILD TIME, not runtime
# - On Railway, set VITE_API_URL before deploying (e.g., https://chess-api.railway.app)
# - If you change VITE_API_URL, you must rebuild and redeploy the web service
# - See apps/web/.env.production.example for production template
